Welcome to our brand new site concerning THOMSON TO8/TO9+ programming.

The goals of our group are :

- to develop an engine to make game creation easier on these 80's computers,
- to show our creations and pending projects,
- to share the knowledge gathered since our way back to the 6809 microprocessor.

More information later on this site!

You can have a look to some tutorials or demo productions.
